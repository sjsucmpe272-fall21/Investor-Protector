## idea1: Teenager Anti-addiction/safely watching system (Xialu)
### Intro to problem:
With the development of electronic technology, there are an increasing number of teenagers and children who use electronic product more frequently. Some of them spend so much time on playing video games, watching Youtuber video, TiK-Tok, NetFlix, that is not only a waste of time but also harmful to their health.
### Abstract:
We can develop an Anti-addiction/safely watching system which askes players to turn on the camera for an identity recognition. The system will be able to identify the player's age range. For example, if the system decide the player is under 16, it will only let the player to play video games/watching video for one hour. Then a warning message will show up. And the connection to the game will be lost.

## idea2: Playdate Setup App (Xialu)
### Intro to problem:
Because of the pandamic of Covid-19 and the shut-down of many areas in the United States. Many parents are tend to keep their 1-4 yeas old children at home instead of sending them to daycares and preschools. This caused a lack of social interaction among the children.
### Abstract:
We can develop a Playdate Setup App which enable parents to share their wish to set-up playdats among children. They can upload their child's profile on the app. And they will be able to find potiential matched nearby. Children's can be matched based on their different needs. For example a shy kid might need to play with an outgoing friend. And children who speak the same language would want to play together. Or if parents want to find a friend that can speak a foreign language for their kid, they might also find a match.  
### Dataset links:
No available real data. 


## idea3: Credit card fraud detection (Jayanth)
### Intro to problem:
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
### Abstract:
 The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one.

## idea4: Profanity filter in chat (Anuhya)
### Intro to problem:
Youth today are subjected to more hate speech online than ever. In the world of chat, any person has the power to abuse and bully online and the number of these situations have been increasing rapidly everyday.
### Abstract:
