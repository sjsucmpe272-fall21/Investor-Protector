## idea1: Teenager Anti-addiction/safely watching system (Xialu)
### Intro to problem:
With the development of electronic technology, there are an increasing number of teenagers and children who use electronic product more frequently. Some of them spend so much time on playing video games, watching Youtuber video, TiK-Tok, NetFlix, that is not only a waste of time but also harmful to their health.
### Abstract:
We can develop an Anti-addiction/safely watching system which askes players to turn on the camera for an identity recognition. The system will be able to identify the player's age range. For example, if the system decide the player is under 16, it will only let the player to play video games/watching video for one hour. Then a warning message will show up. And the connection to the game will be lost.

## idea2: Playdate Setup App (Xialu)
### Intro to problem:
Because of the pandamic of Covid-19 and the shut-down of many areas in the United States. Many parents are tend to keep their 1-4 yeas old children at home instead of sending them to daycares and preschools. This caused a lack of social interaction among the children.
### Abstract:
We can develop a Playdate Setup App which enable parents to share their wish to set-up playdats among children. They can upload their child's profile on the app. And they will be able to find potiential matched nearby. Children's can be matched based on their different needs. For example a shy kid might need to play with an outgoing friend. And children who speak the same language would want to play together. Or if parents want to find a friend that can speak a foreign language for their kid, they might also find a match.  
### Dataset links:
No available real data. 


## idea3: Credit card fraud detection (Jayanth)
### Intro to problem:
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
### Abstract:
 The aim of this R project is to build a classifier that can detect credit card fraudulent transactions. We will use a variety of machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier that will be able to discern fraudulent from non-fraudulent one.

## idea4: Profanity filter in chat (Anuhya)
### Intro to problem:
Youth today are subjected to more hate speech online than ever. In the world of chat, any person has the power to abuse and bully online and the number of these situations have been increasing rapidly everyday.
### Abstract:
To stop this, we can implement a profanity filter as a plugin to chat that flags and conceals the obscene and violent content.

## Idea 3: Preventing Fraud in Fundraisers with Blockchain and Smart Contracts
### Intro to problem:
Every year billions of dollars are lost in badly planned and executed startups that look perfectly legitimate at the first glance

* iBackPack: At first, iBackPack seemed like the perfect Indiegogo investment. It had diagrams, happy videos with lots of millennials, and an interesting concept: An urban backpack that could store, charge and help provide hotspots for iPhones on the go, with plenty of room to spare. It was also vastly successful, raising more than $720,000 in 2015 alone, plus more from Kickstarter. Then iBackPack vanished. YouTube videos were taken down. Communication ceased almost entirely, and updates stopped completely with no word on if the backpacks would ever exist.

We want to create a platform where the probability of investors losing money is drastically decreased, the uncertainty of the project is reduced, and the chances of fraud are mitigated.


### Abstract:
Crowdfunding has revolutionized the way of raising funds for not only start-ups but for all traditional or existing businesses. Crowdfunding made it easy for fundraisers to raise funds as they donâ€™t have to knock on doors of banks and financers and get the desired amount in return of interest or offering equity or even through donation, or reward. Blockchain, on the hand, is decentralizing the system of records and control which makes crowdfunding more transparent and secure. A smart contract is similar to a contract in the physical world, but it is digital and represented by a tiny computer program stored in a blockchain. These smart contracts can be used to implement logic. We want to propose a method that uses smart contract to manage all the activities performed in a crowdfunding campaign.

### Approach:
Online crowdfunding enables people to raise funds for their project. People who are interested in a project can donate by making an online transaction. The existing method of online crowdfunding has a major drawback. It does not allow contributors to have control over the money they have contributed. Since in the existing method the project manager has all the control over the money contributed, he can very easily perform malicious activities. We want to address this problem faced by the existing online crowdfunding platforms by using Ethereum network and smart contract. Using smart contracts we will implement a solution where the campaign manager will be able to send money to any address only after a consensus from the investors is reached.

After a certain percentage of contributors approve the transaction, money is sent to vendor.

Further, we can track on the blockchain where exactly the money is going.
